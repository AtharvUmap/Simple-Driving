# Simple-Driving
Made as a part of the Udemy Course, **Unity C# Mobile Game Development: Make 3 Games From Scratch.**

This repository contains the implentation of a driving game on a track with obstacles (self-designed). It is designed for mobile use where clicking either side of the screen will make the car turn in a direction. The goal is to survive along the track as long as possible (the car speeding up the longer you survive). If you hit the edge or any obstacle, you lose.
